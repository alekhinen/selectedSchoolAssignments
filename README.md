# Selected School Assignments

This is the repo for assignments and projects that I have completed either in class or for on-campus extracurriculars that demonstrate my skills as a programmer. This repo contains snippets of code from games developed in Racket, to sifting through binary trees in Java. 

I will continuously add files to this repo that show my abilities at designing programs. 

Major projects will have their own repos.
